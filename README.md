## Visualize the WORST,BEST and WORST CASE TIME COMPLEXITIES of two major sorting algorithms
# MERGE SORT
# QUICK SORT


I have used numpy Library to create and increase the input sizes.
To represent them in a graph I have used lineplot from matplotlib library

# Open your jupyter notebook 
## STEP 1: import numpy
## STEP 2: import matplotlib

## OR

# TRY THIS IN YOUR Command Prompt and try to install these libraries
